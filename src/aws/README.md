aws
===

This directory contains numerous modules that expose an AWS backend
Clusternator interface.  Meaning a project interface 
(create/describe/destroy) along with similarly theme PR and deployment
interfaces.  Behind those interfaces lie promise wrappers and helpers
that deal with actually talking to AWS.

This section needs a lot of work.  There are a lot of ideas.
